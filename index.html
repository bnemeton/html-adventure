        You finally arrive after...
        <select name="arrivals" id="arrival-select">

            <option id="walk">a barefoot pilgrimage at a leisurely pace.</option>
            <option id="pursuit">a long and heated flight from your mysterious pursuers.</option>
        </select>

        Before you stands the old temple, the destination of your travels. It has been weathered by the ages since its construction, and numerous plants grow in its cracks and along its edges. From without, it is quiet, but smoke from the chimney suggests a fire burns within.
