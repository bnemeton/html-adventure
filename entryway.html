    <p id="horse" hidden>
        You leave your trusty horse to graze outside. There is plenty of fresh grass to eat and he deserves a rest.
    </p>
    <p id="walk" hidden>
       Your feet are sore, but you know rest awaits you inside.
    </p>
    <p id="pursuit" hidden>
        You can only hope your pursuers will not think to search this dilapidated old temple, and that whomever you find within will help to hide you.
    </p>
    <p id="secret" hidden>
        You are confident none know of your presence here, save perhaps the temple's keeper waiting within.
    </p>

    You have entered the temple after arriving<span id="text"></span>.

    Beyond the worn wooden door is an entryway.
